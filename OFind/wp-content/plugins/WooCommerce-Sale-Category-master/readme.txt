Automatically assign products on sale to a specified category

== Description ==

Ever wanted a category that listed only discounted products?
Sure, you could use the [sale] shortcode, but this solution includes the link in category list.

Every time a product price is changed, this plugin checks if it is on sale and assigns/unassigns it to a category you can pick in WooCommerce Integration settings.

Already have products on sale? There is a bulk action!

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-sale-category` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I already have many products on sale, is there a bulk action? =

Yep! Just select your sale category and check the Process existing products box.
Be careful if you have a lot of products.

= What happens if a schedule a sale? =

Your products will magically appear in the discounted category when the time comes.
And disappear when the time passes.
